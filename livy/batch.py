        e.g. ["s3://bucket/object", "hdfs://path/to/file", ...] and must be
        reachable by the Spark driver process. If the provided URL has no
        scheme, it's considered to be relative to the default file system
        configured in the Livy server.

        URLs in the py_files argument are copied to a temporary staging area
        and inserted into Python's sys.path ahead of the standard library
        paths. This allows you to import .py, .zip and .egg files in Python.

        URLs for jars, py_files, files and archives arguments are all copied to
        the same working directory on the Spark cluster.

        The driver_memory and executor_memory arguments have the same format as
        JVM memory strings with a size unit suffix ("k", "m", "g" or "t") (e.g.
        512m, 2g).
